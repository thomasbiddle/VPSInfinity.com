# VPSInfinity.com Website

Seeing as the website is shutting down, this repo is pretty bare bones. It was originally a WordPress website; however when migrating hosts I had decided on writing a new design from scratch but never got around to it - which is what this repository is for. The rest of the website uses <a href="http://whmcs.com">WHMCS</a> for billing and <a href="http://solusvm.com">SolusVM</a> for VM management - Just linking to the WHMCS product page was enough to get the job done in the meantime.

Although, just for shits and giggles I may update this repository to be automated via Puppet in the future, just so it can match the rest of my sites for their deployment process as the site will remain live.
