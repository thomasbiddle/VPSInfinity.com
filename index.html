      <h1>VPSInfinity.com is shutting down indefinitely.</h1>
      <p>Due to the decrease in the demand for Runescape Virtual Private Servers (VPS) - VPSInfinity.com will be closing it's doors. For a variety of reasons, it does not make sense to continue the service as is. For those of you who still have a service active with us, links to the our payment portal and VPS control panel are available below. We will not be accepting any new customers, however invoices have already been sent out for the following month - If enough choose to re-new, then we will keep enough servers online to serve those customers for the duration of their billing period; however if not - then we will refund those customers.

        <h5>Your questions - Our answers:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Why are you closing down?</b></li>
          Since re-opening our doors earlier this year, we've noticed from the start that there hasn't been nearly as much of a demand for our services as there was when we started initially back in 2010. Runescape Gold Prices have plummeted and the botting software is not up to par with what it used to be - driving away potential customers. Resources spent on VPSInfinity.com (Mainly, our time) can be better spent creating something new, and exciting!
          <li><b>What do you mean "indefinitely"?</b></li>
          We mean <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/indefinitely">indefinitely</a>. Who knows - maybe things will really take off again and it will make sense to put things back into motion. Until that happens, if it ever does, we will remain closed down.
          <li><b>Do you suggest any alternatives to VPSInfinity.com?</b></li>
          Check out the list in the <a href="http://www.powerbot.org/community/forum/56-other/">"Other"</a> section on PowerBot - There are a few other, lesser known sellers there - I can't vouch for their quality, but hopefully someone will pick up the ball.
        </ul>
      </p>

          Really everyone, thank you for your continued support and loyalty to VPSInfinity.com over the years - without your suggestions on how to improve our service, recommendations to friends, and extra things such as YouTube videos, guides, and reviews we would have never gotten to be where we stand now: Over 1000 unique customers served! Have a great day, and best of luck in all of your gaming adventures!
